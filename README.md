# Puppers 'n' Kiddos

## What is this?

Kids grow quickly, and do some funny things along the way. It can be hard to find ways to keep track of the things they do and say. 

Puppers 'n' Kiddos is an app that allows for easy capture, storage, and sharing of short stories and pictures of kids and pets, but without any of your uncle's political rantings or mass scale privacy scandals of social networks. 

It is intended for limited use by my own family. It will be organized by child or pet, provide an easy way to upload a short story or picture with caption, and provide an easy way to view entries for each child or pet. You'll also be able to view all entries across a family, or all entries.
